= Unreal Engine

Satisfactory uses a customized version of Unreal Engine (UE) 5.3.2 by Epic Games as its game engine.
UE provides a solid framework for developing fast executing native code and a interface for artists to use a more easy way for creating content.

Although this section is titled "Unreal Engine",
it only aims to cover Unreal concepts that are especially relevant to modding Satisfactory
or must be done differently due to modding/Satisfactory intricacies.
