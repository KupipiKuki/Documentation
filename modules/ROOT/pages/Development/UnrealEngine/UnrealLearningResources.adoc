= Unreal Learning Resources

Although this documentation site covers many aspects of modding Satisfactory,
there is a lot of core Unreal Engine knowledge that you must acquire on your own from other tutorials.
This page contains a list of some of those other tutorials.

Entries with a 📖 are primarily written, 📽 have a video component, and ⭐ are the ones we find especially useful and informative.

== Disclaimer: Satisfactory Could Be Different

Because Satisfactory is an established Unreal Engine game with its own systems,
there are a lot of Unreal Engine systems you don't need to worry about
Coffee Stain has already implemented them.

Furthemore, some Unreal concepts do not carry over to Satisfactory because
Coffee Stain has implemented their own systems instead.
The most obvious example of this are machines and the lightweight buildable system -
any buildings you create should use the optimized systems provided by Coffee Stain
wherever possible instead of trying to implement your own.

Some tutorials can't be followed in the Satisfactory Unreal project because
they rely on Play-in-Editor (PIE) functionality that the project lacks code for.
You'll have to install a separate copy of Unreal Engine 5 and create a separate project to follow those.

Keep this in mind as you follow other tutorials.
